# Lab - 3 : Symmetric encryption & hashing

In this lab, I will perform symmetric encryption and hashing utilising one of the most widely
used crypto tools called `Openssl`. It is widely used in Internet web servers, serving a majority
of all web sites. OpenSSL contains an open-source implementation of the `SSL` and `TLS`
protocols. The core library, written in the C programming language, implements basic
cryptographic functions and provides various utility functions. Wrappers allowing the use of
the OpenSSL library in a variety of computer languages are available.

`Git Bash` is a terminal emulator for Windows that provides a Unix-like command-line experience. Git Bash is suitable for running OpenSSL commands. Since Git Bash provides a Unix-like environment on Windows, it can be used to execute OpenSSL commands. OpenSSL is typically included in the installation package. When installing Git for Windows.

We also need to use an HEX editor like GHex in Ubuntu. HEX editor allow us to view and edit the binary data of files. In windows, we will use `HEX Workshop`. [install](https://download.cnet.com/hex-workshop)

To check if OpenSSL is available in Git Bash, you can simply open Git Bash and type the following command:

```
openssl version
```

This command will display the version of OpenSSL installed on your system, if it is available.
